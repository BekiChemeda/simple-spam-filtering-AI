# simple-spam-filtering-AI
This is a simple Spam Filter AI I built while practicing Naive Bayes. It classifies emails as spam or not (ham) using basic machine learning techniques. If you think it will help, feel free to use the code. I'll also be updating it from time to time to improve its functionality and performance, so stay tuned for more features!
